# xsz - A Multi-threaded Btrfs Compression Analysis Tool

This is a rewrite of `compsize`, but faster, and use less memory.

## Introduction

`xsz` is an open-source tool designed to measure the used compression types
and effective compression ratios of files on a Btrfs filesystem,
producing a comprehensive report. It is inspired by [compsize](https://github.com/kilobyte/compsize)
and maintains compatibility with its command-line interface.
However, xsz goes a step further by incorporating a variety of optimization techniques
to significantly enhance performance,
particularly on NVMe SSDs or with hot metadata cache, while also delivering substantial
speed improvements across a wider range of hardware configurations.
Under cache-hot conditions, it achieves over 50% higher performance even in single-threaded mode,
and scales further to deliver markedly faster speeds when running with multiple threads.

## Installation

With Nix, run xsz directly from the flake:

```sh
nix run github:SaltyKitkat/xsz -- /path/to/dir
```

Or install it into your profile:

```sh
nix profile add github:SaltyKitkat/xsz
```

The flake also provides a Rust development shell through `nix develop`.

## Usage

`xsz` follows the same command-line syntax as `compsize`. To get started, simply run:

```sh

xsz /path/to/dir
```

For more detailed usage instructions and options, refer to the help message:

```console
xsz --help
Usage: xsz [options] file-or-dir1 [file-or-dir2 ...]

xsz displays total space used by set of files, taking into account
compression, reflinks, partially overwritten extents.

Options:
    -h, --help              print this help message and exit
    -b, --bytes             display raw bytes instead of human-readable sizes
    -x, --one-file-system   don't cross filesystem boundaries
    -j N, --jobs=N          allow N jobs at once
    -t, --tree-scan         scan btrfs tree instead of walking directory (faster on subvolumes)
```

## Important Notes

This project has not undergone rigorous testing. Use it in production environments at your own risk.

**`-t` / `--tree-scan` mode** scans the btrfs tree per-inode instead of
walking the directory hierarchy. Disk Usage and Uncompressed numbers
are consistent between modes. The "Referenced" column will differ when
hardlinks exist: walkdir counts each path's reference separately, while
tree-scan counts each extent once.

**Inline extent dedup** deduplicates by inode number only. This works
correctly for hardlinks and snapshots (same inode = same data), but may
under-count if the same inode number happens to appear in different
subvolumes for unrelated files.

## Changelog

### 0.5.0 — 2026-06-29

- **`-t` / `--tree-scan`**: new flag to scan btrfs tree directly instead of
  walking directory hierarchy. Up to 4× faster on large subvolumes.
- **Inline dedup**: xsz now deduplicates inline extents by inode
- **Symlink support**: symlinks (stored as inline extents in btrfs) are now
  counted.

## FAQ

Q: Why you write `xsz`?

A: Because `compsize` is so useful for me, but sometimes too slow. I had a try to speed it up, and `xsz` is the result.
   I'm glad that I can get a more than 4x speed up by using `xsz`.

Q: Why rust?

A: Because rust makes me, who is too stupid to write correct multi-thread programs in C,
   able to write a working multi-thread program. You know, multi-threading is important when you want to make
   some cpu bounded tasks faster.

Q: But is `compsize` really a cpu bounded task? Does multi-threading really work in this case?

A: Yes, and no. The task is actually at somewhere between cpu bounded and io bounded.
   If you run `compsize` on a fast enough disk, let's say, NVMe SSD, then you'll
   find that the cpu usage can be more than 50%, and reaching above 90%, while the load of SSD is quite low.
   So, yes, it is kind of a cpu bounded task. But if you run `compsize` on a HDD,
   you'll find that most time is spent on waiting the disk. So it's more like a io bounded task.

Q: So does `xsz` also run faster on HDD?

A: Yes! I think it's because we do a lot less open and close syscalls.
   So even running in single thread, `xsz` is a lot faster than `compsize`.
   But multi-threading hardly improve the performance in this case.

Q: Why `xsz` is faster?

A: TL;DR: Because we use multi-threading, and do less syscalls.

   Longer version:
   
   - we reduce a lot of unnecessary open and close syscalls;
   
   - we use multi-threading to call ioctl, which costs most time;
   
   - we use multi-threading to walkdir because when cache is hot, a single-thread walkdir can be the bottleneck.

   - `-t` mode skips directory walks entirely by scanning the btrfs tree directly.
     This avoids opening each file individually and is especially faster on large subvolumes.
     Both modes now count symlinks (stored as inline extents in btrfs) and handle
     hardlinks consistently for Disk Usage and Uncompressed numbers.

   Full version: I'm too lazy to finish this part now...

Q: Oh, yes, `xsz` seems good. Can I use it as a dropin replacement for `compsize`?

A: Yes, and no. We try to have the same cli-arguments with `compsize`, but we added a `-j`
   so you can set the number of worker threads, and `-t` to enable tree scan mode.
   And, `xsz` is not widely used and tested like `compsize`. So welcome to have a try.
   And if you find the result is different from `compsize`,
   it's expected because we do real rounding instead of just drop the tail like `compsize`
   since v0.4.1 release(commit 9549fa5).

Q: How many worker threads should I set on my machine?

A: I don't know. It depends on your cpu and disk. You can try to increase worker threads until
   either your cpu or your disk is under 100% load.
